I am a member of the [Higgs Centre](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/hansen-maxwell-t/) and the [Particle Physics Theory](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/maxwell-hansen) group at the University of Edinburgh. I joined the group in 2020 with the support of an impressive new initiative aimed at a wide range of UK-based researchers: [The UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/developing-people-and-skills/future-leaders-fellowships/). I go by 'Max', but I use my full name for [research publications](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1217906?ui-citation-summary=true).

Before coming to Edinburgh, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Helmholz Institute in Mainz, Germany, and a fellow, and later a staff member, in the Theory Department at CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Washington in 2014, under the exceptional supervision of Steve Sharpe.
