This workshop focuses on multi-particle reactions in nuclear and particle physics, which are essential for understanding quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and testing the Standard Model. It will bring together researchers from fields such as lattice QCD, scattering theory, effective field theories, and experimental hadron spectroscopy.

Hosted by UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL), the event aims to foster collaboration, and explore innovative approaches in the topics of rare electroweak decays, few-/many-body methods, and novel techniques for strongly interacting theories.

The workshop will include talks, discussions, and a special session honoring Steve Sharpe’s career. It follows a two-week summer school for graduate students and postdocs.  The event is co-sponsored by multiple institutions, including LANL, ORNL, JST ASPIRE, and EMMI.
