title: Three-pion scattering from lattice QCD
event: JLab Cake Seminar
location: JLab (Virtual)
summary:
abstract: In this talk, I will present a lattice-QCD calculation of the maximal-isospin, three-pion scattering amplitude (3π+ to 3π+). The calculation combines finite-volume energies with a relativistic field-theoretic formalism, required to interpret the results. I will describe the full work-flow required to reach the final amplitude, implemented here for the first time, and discuss the complicated singularities appearing in the latter. Finally I will discuss prospects for applying these methods to resonant three-particle systems, in order to gain a deeper understanding of these complicated objects from first principles QCD.
