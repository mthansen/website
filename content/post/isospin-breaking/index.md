This is a summary of our recently posted article, entitled "[Isospin-breaking corrections to light-meson leptonic decays from lattice simulations at physical quark masses]({{< ref "/publication/boyle-2022-lsi" >}})". In this work we examine effects that have traditionally been ignored in numerical lattice calculations, but are now becoming important due to increased precision. In particular, we calculate the correction to a ratio of leptonic decay rates from both electromagnetism (the effect of photons on the decays) and the mass difference of the two light quarks (the effect on the decays from the up and down quark having different masses). The work a lattice calculation with dynamical quarks that have close to physical masses. One of our main focuses is the role of the finite volume of the calculation, which is very important because the finite-volume effects are enhanced when photons are included.

<!-- The quantum theory of electromagnetism, called quantum electrodynamics (QED), was developed in the 1930s and 1940s by many physicists, including Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, and Richard Feynman. Over the theory has pre- or post-dicted the results of a wide range of experiments with unprecedented accuracy. In fact, QED is considered one of the most successful and well-tested theories in physics. -->
