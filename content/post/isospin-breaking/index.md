This is a summary of the article [_Isospin-breaking corrections to light-meson leptonic decays from lattice simulations at physical quark masses_]({{< ref "/publication/boyle-2022-lsi" >}}). In this paper, we investigate effects that have been neglected in numerical lattice calculations in the past, but are now becoming important due to increased precision. In particular, we calculate the correction to a ratio of leptonic decay rates from two closely related effects. The first is electromagnetism (the effect of photons on the decays) and the second is the mass difference of the two light quarks (the effect on the decays of the up and down quarks having different masses). One of the main focuses of the article is the role of finite volume in the calculation, which is very important because the finite-volume effects are enhanced when photons are included.

A precise determination of the ratio of leptonic decay rates of kaons and pions into muons and neutrinos is useful for precision tests of the Standard Model. In particular, combining such results with experimental inputs allows one to extract the ratio of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements $|V_{us}|$ and $|V_{ud}|$.

This particular work employs lattice QCD simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical quarks with near-physical masses, utilizing MÃ¶bius domain wall fermions. Electromagnetic interactions are incorporated using the QED${}_L$ prescription. The study highlights the significant impact of the finite spatial volume on electromagnetic corrections of such decay rates, identifying this as the leading source of uncertainty in the study.
